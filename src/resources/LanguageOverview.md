## RSI - Rhino Semantic Interface

[Back](#units)

`RSI` or `Rhino Semantic Interface` was designed to deliver an abstract, human readable interface for describing actions chain. you can consider `RSI` as a markup language similar to `YAML` or `XML`. It has a [schema](#default-schema), simple syntax and basic rules to follow.

`RSI` describes a sequence of actions, instructions of how to perform them and what parameters and values to pass to these actions - if needed. Each action in the chain is completely isolated from the other actions and it runs as a standalone component inside an isolated `sandbox`.

The `RSI`, in contrast to other markup languages does not rely on fields to identify the elements the user provides, rather it relies on semantics and verbs. Consider the following example, which describes a simple click action using various markup languages with the equivalent `RSI` expression:  

### Action Example

#### RSI

```none
[test-actions]
click on {#element_id} using {css selector}
```

#### YAML

```yaml
- testActions: My Actions Chain
  - action:
    inputs:
      type: 'Click'
      onElement: '#element_id'
      locator: 'CssSelector'
```

#### XML

```xml
<testActions>
    <action>
        <type>Click</type>
        <onElement>#element_id</onElement>
        <locator>CssSelector</locator>
    </action>
</testActions>
```

#### JSON

```json
{
    "testActions":[
        {
            "type": "Click",
            "onElement": "#element_id",
            "locator": "CssSelector"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Default Schema

[Back](#units)

`RSI` follows a simple schema and some basic rules and guideline which includes **verbs** to identify the different schema fields.

### Fields & Verbs

`RSI` verbs are used to identify the schema fields. Each field is identified by one or more verbs.  
  
> _**INFORMATION**_
>  
> It does not matter which verb you choose to use to identify the desired field and the only reason for multiple verbs is to make the sentence more readable.
>  
> `click on {element}` and `click into {element}` are identical and will work in the same way, the difference is that the 2nd phrase is less readable.

#### `action` Field - Mandatory

Verbs: None.  
  
The action to perform. This will be the action name as a `space case` e.g., `click`, `send keys`, `send get request`.
Action field does not need a verb and it is automatically identified.  
  
A list of all available actions can be retrieved from the following address <http://server-address:port/api/v3/meta/plugins/references>

#### `onElement` Field - Optional

Verbs: `on`, `into`, `of`, `take`, `to`  
  
The subject (element or entity) to perform the action on. This can vary, depends on the action implementation and can be a UI element, web address, etc.
This field is optional and there are no restrictions to implement it when creating an action, please see the following examples:  

* `click on {element}` - clicks on an element provided under the `onElement` filed and identified by the `on` verb.
* `click` - click on the last known location on the physical screen - no element provided.

#### `onAttribute` Field - Optional

Verbs: `from`  
  
The subject (element or entity) to take additional information from. This can vary, depends on the action implementation and can be a UI element, web address, etc.
This field is optional and there are not restrictions to implement it when creating an action, please see the following examples:  
  
* `go to url {https://notarealaddress.io}` - Navigate to the URL provided by the user under the [`argument`](#argument-field---optional) field.
* `go to url take {element} from {href}` - Navigate to the URL that found under the `href` attribute of the element provided by the user.

#### `argument` Field - Optional

Verbs: None.  
  
Additional information to pass with the action. Arguments can be flat or integrated, depends on the specific action implementation. There is no need for verbs to identify argument field.  

* `go to url {https://notarealaddress.io}` - The argument filed pass the URL needed for the action to run.
* `go to url {{$ --url:https://notarealaddress.io --blank}}` - the argument is an integrated argument that can pass multiple parameters, in that case to open the URL in a new tab.

#### `locator` Field - Optional

Verbs: `using`, `by`

This filed is mostly used by UI actions and it is desired to pass additional information about how to located the desired UI element.  

* `click on {element} using {id}` - will click on an element using the `id` locator.
* `click on {element}` - if this filed was not provided the default locator will be `xpath`.

#### `regularExpression` Field - Optional

Verbs: `pattern`, `filter`, `regex`

This field was designed to allow manipulation on the values before the value is passed to the action by providing a [regular expression](https://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorial.html).  

* `go to url take {element} filter {(http(s)?:\/\/)www.*io}` - Navigate to a URL which can be found under a text of the provided element. The regular expression allows you to extract only the URL from the text before passing it to the action.

## Tokens & Verbs

[Back](#units)

`RSI` phrase is divided into tokens. Each token identifies a [schema filed](#fields--verbs). There is no meaning to the tokens order and they can be written in any order as long as the schema rules are not violated.

### Token Grammar

`[action] {argument} [on|into|of|take|to] {element} [from] {attribute} [by|using] {locator} [filter|pattern|regex] {regular expression}`  

* `action` field must be a space case convention of the action name, e.g., if the action name is `SendKeys` the `RSI` version will be `send keys`.
* `argument` filed have no verbs and must be surrounded by **curly brackets**.
* `onElement`, `onAttribute`, `locator` & `regularExpression` fields must be identified by [one of their verbs](#fields--verbs) and must be surrounded by **curly brackets**.

#### Examples

* `go to url {https://notarealaddress.io}` - action and argument.
* `go to url take {element} by {id}` - action, element and locator (will take the url from the element text).
* `go to url {{$ --blank}} take {element} by {id}` - action, argument, element and locator.
* `click` - action only.
* `click on {element}` - action and element (default locator).
* `invoke oracle query {SELECT * FROM myTable} on {connection string to database}` - action, argument, and element.
